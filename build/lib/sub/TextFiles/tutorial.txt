MINECRAFT: The Text Based Adventure is Minecraft in a text-based format.
When you begin, you will wake up in a random biome with a random amount of resources around you.
You must learn how to collect resources, build shelter, and survive the nights.
Eventually you will have to make your way to the END to complete the game.
Once you complete the game, try to find some of the secret sprinkled across the game.
They only show up after your completion.
Good luck!
